## Project Internal Setup

The Li-Fi based audio transmission system consists of two main sections:
the **Transmitter Unit** and the **Receiver Unit**. Both units are aligned
optically to enable audio signal transmission through visible light.

### Transmitter Section (Audio to Light Conversion)

**Key Function:**  
Converts electrical audio signals into modulated visible light.

- An audio source is connected through an **audio jack**.
- The audio signal modulates the intensity of an **LED**.
- A **current-limiting resistor (470Ω)** is used to protect the LED.
- The LED emits light whose intensity varies according to the audio signal.
- This modulated light acts as the transmission medium.

### Receiver Section (Light to Audio Conversion)

**Key Function:**  
Converts modulated light back into an electrical audio signal.

- A **solar panel** is used as the optical receiver.
- The panel converts the received modulated light into an electrical signal.
- The weak electrical signal is amplified.
- The amplified signal is fed to a **speaker**, producing audible sound.

### Optical Alignment

- Proper alignment between the LED and solar panel is critical.
- Direct line-of-sight communication is required.
- Ambient light can introduce noise and affect signal quality.
- Better in dark room where light incidence on the solar panel is less.

---

### Power Supply

- A **9V DC battery** supplies power to the transmitter circuit.
- The receiver operates using the electrical output generated by the solar panel.

---

### Signal Flow Summary

Audio Source → LED (Transmitter) → Visible Light → Solar Panel (Receiver) → Amplifier → Speaker

---

### Key Observations

- Audio quality depends on LED brightness and alignment.
- External light sources can introduce interference.
- The system works best in controlled lighting conditions.
