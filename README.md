\# Li-Fi Based Audio Transmission System



\## Overview

This project demonstrates a Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) based audio transmission system

where audio signals are transmitted wirelessly using visible light instead of radio

frequency waves.



The system uses an LED as the transmitter and a solar panel as the receiver,

enabling short-range optical wireless communication.

\## Objectives

\- Demonstrate audio transmission using visible light

\- Design transmitter and receiver circuits

\- Analyze received audio output signal

\- Understand Li-Fi communication principles
